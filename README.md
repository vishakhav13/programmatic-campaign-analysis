Beginner-friendly marketing campaign analysis using Python and simulated data.
# ðŸ“Š Simulated Programmatic Campaign Analysis

This project analyzes a fake dataset inspired by programmatic ad campaigns (like StackAdapt). Using Python and pandas, I explored key performance metrics:

- Click-Through Rate (CTR)
- Conversion Rate (CVR)
- Cost Per Acquisition (CPA)
- Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)

I used seaborn and matplotlib to visualize performance by channel, region, and campaign. This beginner-friendly project helped me practice data storytelling using real marketing KPIs.
